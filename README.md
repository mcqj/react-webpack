# React Webpack Template
This is a template for a React app, built with `webpack`.
This template does not use any build tools, such as `create-react-app`.
While less convenient, this provides a less opinionated build, retaining greater
control of the build process.

The React App is relatively simple as the aim of the template is to provide a
good starting point for the build process, rather than any particular React starter.

:information_source: **This template is developed for webpack 5 and React 18.**
